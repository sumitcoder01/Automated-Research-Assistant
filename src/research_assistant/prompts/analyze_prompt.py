**Recent Conversation History (Truncated):**
{truncated_history}

**Latest User Query:**
{query}

**Classify the Latest User Query into ONE of the following categories:**

1.  **ANSWER_DIRECTLY:**
    *   Simple greetings, farewells, thanks.
    *   General knowledge questions answerable without external search (e.g., "What is 2+2?").
    *   Questions about the *immediately preceding* turns of the conversation (e.g., User asks question, AI answers, User asks "Can you explain that differently?").
    *   Explicit requests to summarize the *ongoing conversation history itself* (e.g., "Summarize what we just talked about"). -> Treat this as a direct answer task using history.

2.  **NEEDS_SEARCH:**
    *   Requires real-time information (e.g., "What's the weather today?", "Latest stock price for GOOGL?", "Current news headlines?").
    *   Requires specific, up-to-date facts or information *not* likely known by a general LLM or present in the immediate history (e.g., "Details about the latest LangChain library release?", "Who won the recent F1 race?").
    *   Requires information from external documents or URLs not already processed.

3.  **NEEDS_COMPLEX_PROCESSING:**
    *   Requires multiple steps beyond a single search query (e.g., "Compare Python and Java features.", "Analyze the pros and cons of electric cars.").
    *   Involves analysis, synthesis, comparison, evaluation, or generating a structured report based on potentially multiple information sources.
    *   Requests to summarize information *about a specific topic* that requires external search first (e.g., "Summarize the theory of relativity" - this needs search *then* summarization/synthesis).

**Output Format:**
Respond with ONLY the chosen classification keyword on the first line (`ANSWER_DIRECTLY`, `NEEDS_SEARCH`, `NEEDS_COMPLEX_PROCESSING`).
If `NEEDS_SEARCH` or `NEEDS_COMPLEX_PROCESSING`, provide a concise search query on the *second* line, suitable for a web search engine, based *only* on the **Latest User Query**.

**Example 1 (Direct Answer - History Related):**
History: Human: Tell me about LangGraph... AI: LangGraph is a fram...
Query: Can you summarize what we just discussed?
Output:
ANSWER_DIRECTLY

**Example 2 (Direct Answer - General):**
History: Human: Hi AI: Hello!
Query: What is the capital of France?
Output:
ANSWER_DIRECTLY

**Example 3 (Needs Search):**
History: Human: Hi AI: Hello!
Query: What's the weather in London right now?
Output:
NEEDS_SEARCH
weather in London now

**Example 4 (Complex Processing -> Needs Search First):**
History: (empty)
Query: Compare the advantages of solar versus wind power.
Output:
NEEDS_COMPLEX_PROCESSING
advantages solar versus wind power comparison

**Example 5 (Complex Processing -> Topic Summary -> Needs Search First):**
History: (empty)
Query: Give me a summary of the main points of the Paris Agreement.
Output:
NEEDS_COMPLEX_PROCESSING
main points Paris Agreement summary
